        <h1><u>3.1 Process of Photosynthesis</u></h1>
        <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less8.jpg" alt="Process of Photosynthesis">
        <p><b>Plants use carbondioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight to compose glucose and oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis.Photosynthesis takes
            place in the chloroplast of the green parts of plants buy mainly in the leaves.
        <br> Photosynthesis is a physio-chemical process carried out by photo-auto-lithotrophs. In simpler language, photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into ‘chemical energy’.

        This energy transformation is only possible due to the presence of the miraculous pigment molecule chlorophyll in photosynthesis. The chemical energy as referred to before is the fixed carbon molecules generated during photosynthesis.
        
        Green plants and algae have the ability to utilize carbon dioxide molecules and water and produce food (carbohydrates) for all life forms on Earth. There’s no doubt in the fact that life is impossible and unimaginable without green plants that photosynthesize and sustain the cycles of life.

         <h1><u>3.1.1 Structure of a leaf</u></h1>
        <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less9.jpg" >
        <p><b>A leaf is a vital part of a plant designed to carry out photosynthesis, exchange gases, and sometimes store food. 
            Each leaf typically has a leaf blade ( lamina ), stipules, a midrib, and a margin. Some leaves have a petiole, which attaches the leaf to the stem; leaves that do not have petioles are directly attached to the plant stem and are called sessile leaves.
            External Structure
            Blade (Lamina):
            The flat, wide part of the leaf that captures sunlight. It has veins running through it.
            
            Petiole:
            The stalk that connects the leaf blade to the stem of the plant.
            
            Midrib:
            The central vein that supports the leaf and carries water and nutrients.
            
            Veins:
            A network of smaller veins branching from the midrib. They transport water, minerals, and food throughout the leaf.
            
            Leaf Margin:
            The edge of the leaf, which can be smooth, wavy, or serrated.

         <h1><u>Epidermis</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less12.jpg" alt="">
         <p><b>The epidermis is the outermost layer of cells in leaves, stems, roots, and other plant parts. It plays a protective role and has special features that support the plant’s survival.
            Functions of the Epidermis
            Protection:
            Shields inner tissues from physical damage and pathogens.
            Water Loss Prevention:The cuticle minimizes water evaporation.
            Gas Exchange:Contains stomata, tiny pores that allow gases like carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water vapor to move in and out of the leaf.
            Light Transmission:Allows sunlight to penetrate into the mesophyll layers for photosynthesis.
            Secretion:Produces the waxy cuticle and sometimes hairs or spines to protect against herbivores or excessive sunlight.

         <h1><u>Mesophyll</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less11.jpg" alt="">
         <p><b>The mesophyll is the inner tissue of a leaf, located between the upper and lower epidermis. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, as it contains most of the leaf's chloroplasts, which are responsible for capturing sunlight.
            Photosynthesis:Palisade mesophyll absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy (glucose).
            Gas Exchange:Air spaces in the spongy mesophyll allow gases to move freely between cells and the stomata.
            Water Distribution:The mesophyll helps distribute water and nutrients coming from the veins (vascular bundles) to the cells for photosynthesis.

         <h1><u>Veins</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less10.jpg" alt="">
         <p><b>The veins in a leaf, also called vascular bundles, are an essential part of the leaf's structure. They serve as the transportation network, carrying water, nutrients, and food throughout the leaf and the plant.
            Structure of Veins
            Xylem:Transports water and minerals absorbed by the roots to the leaf.Located in the upper part of the vein.
            Phloem:Transports glucose (food produced during photosynthesis) from the leaf to other parts of the plant.Located in the lower part of the vein.
            Bundle Sheath:A layer of protective cells surrounding the xylem and phloem.
            Helps support the vein and regulate the exchange of substances.

            Functions of Veins
            Transport:
            Xylem: Delivers water and minerals to the leaf for photosynthesis.
            Phloem: Distributes food (sugar) produced in the leaf to the rest of the plant.
            Support:Provides structural support to the leaf, maintaining its shape and preventing wilting.
            Connection:Links the leaf to the rest of the plant's vascular system, ensuring the flow of essential substances.

         <h1><u>Chloroplast</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less3.png" alt="">
         <p><b>A chloroplast is an important part of plant cells and some algae. It’s the place where photosynthesis happens, allowing plants to make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.
            Structure of a Chloroplast
            A chloroplast has several parts that work together to capture sunlight and produce energy:
            Outer Membrane:A smooth outer layer that protects the chloroplast.
            Inner Membrane:Located just inside the outer membrane, it controls the movement of materials in and out of the chloroplast.
            Stroma:The fluid-filled space inside the chloroplast.Contains enzymes for the Calvin Cycle (light-independent reactions).
            Thylakoids:Flattened, disc-shaped structures stacked like coins to form grana.
            Contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that absorbs sunlight. This is where light-dependent reactions occur.
            Granum (plural: Grana):A stack of thylakoids that increases the surface area for capturing sunlight.
            Lamellae:Thin, flat membranes connecting the grana and helping in the transport of materials.
            DNA and Ribosomes:Chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, enabling them to produce some of their proteins independently.

         <h1><u>Light and Dark Reactions of Photosynthesis</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less6.png" alt="">
         <p><b>Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: Light Reactions and Dark Reactions (also known as the Calvin Cycle). Both processes are interconnected and occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
            1. Light Reactions (Light-Dependent Reactions)
            Where It Happens: In the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
            When It Happens:Only in the presence of light.
            What Happens: Sunlight 
            Absorption: Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, exciting electrons to a higher energy state.
           Splitting of Water (Photolysis):
           Water molecules are split into:
           Oxygen (O₂): Released into the air.
           Protons (H⁺): Used to create energy carriers.
           Electrons: Replace lost electrons in chlorophyll.
           
           Production of Energy Carriers:
           ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate): Stores energy.
           NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate): Transfers high-energy electrons to the Calvin Cycle.
           Outputs:
           ATP and NADPH: Used in the dark reactions.
           Oxygen: Released as a by-product.
           
           2. Dark Reactions (Light-Independent Reactions / Calvin Cycle)
           Where It Happens:In the stroma of chloroplasts.
           When It Happens:Does not require light directly but uses energy from the light reactions (ATP and NADPH).
           What Happens:
           Carbon Fixation:Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere combines with a 5-carbon molecule called RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate), catalyzed by the enzyme Rubisco.
           Formation of 3-Carbon Molecules:The resulting unstable 6-carbon molecule splits into two 3-carbon molecules called 3-PGA (3-phosphoglycerate).
           Reduction Phase:ATP and NADPH convert 3-PGA into G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), a high-energy 3-carbon sugar.
           Regeneration of RuBP:Some G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, allowing the cycle to continue.
           Glucose Formation:Two G3P molecules combine to form one molecule of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).
           Outputs:
           Glucose: Used by the plant for energy or stored as starch.
           ADP and NADP⁺: Sent back to the light reactions to be recharged.

         <h1><u>Factors Affecting Photosynthesis</u></h1>
         <img class="img_deg" src="./images/less5.webp" alt="">
         <p><b>Several internal and external factors influence the rate of photosynthesis. These factors determine how efficiently plants can produce glucose and oxygen.
            1. Light Intensity
            Effect:As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases until the plant reaches a saturation point. Beyond this point, the rate will no longer rise because other factors, such as carbon dioxide or temperature, may become limiting.
            Limitation: In very low light, photosynthesis slows down or stops.

            2. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Concentration
            Effect:Higher CO₂ levels can increase the rate of photosynthesis because CO₂ is a raw material for the Calvin Cycle.
            However, beyond a certain concentration, the rate plateaus as other factors become limiting.
            Limitation:Low CO₂ levels reduce the rate of photosynthesis.
            
            3. Temperature
            Effect:Photosynthesis is an enzyme-driven process, so it works best within an optimal temperature range (20–35°C for most plants).
            At low temperatures, enzymes become less active, reducing the rate.
            At very high temperatures, enzymes may denature, stopping photosynthesis.
            Limitation:Extreme temperatures (too high or too low) can severely impact photosynthesis.
